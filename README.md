# Ethan's 1.20.X Fabric Vanilla+ Server
Welcome to the download and info page for Ethan's 1.20.4+ Minecraft Server.

The server's current version is: 1.20.4

The server is a modded Fabric server using a custom Vanilla+ modpack. The mod pack can be found here along with a list of all included mods.

Steps to set up Fabric Minecraft and install the mod pack.

1. Install the Fabric Installer [here](https://maven.fabricmc.net/net/fabricmc/fabric-installer/1.0.1/fabric-installer-1.0.1.exe).
2. Run the installer and select the current version of the server from the version list (1.20.4) in the client tab. Check "Create profile" and click install.
3. Launch Minecraft using the 1.20.4 Fabric profile in the Minecraft Launcher and then close Minecraft. This is to ensure proper creation of the "mods" folder.
4. Download the mod pack from this github page and unzip the mod pack.
5. Navigate to your ".minecraft" file location in File Explorer (loacted under %appdata%) and open the "mods" folder.
6. Move the unzipped set of mods (NOT the folder itself) into the "mods" folder.
7. Relaunch Minecraft using the same Fabric profile in the Minecraft Launcher. The modded version of Minecraft should now be running with version info displayed on the title screen.
8. Add the server to your multiplayer server using the I.P. address in our Discord channel or other server member and join.
9. You will be prompted to install a resource pack for the server. Click yes on this prompt. The resource pack will also be available on this github page for manual downloads.
10. You should be all set!
